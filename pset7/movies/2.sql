/*
In 2.sql, write a SQL query to determine the birth year of Emma Stone.
Your query should output a table with a single column
and a single row (not including the header)
containing Emma Stoneâ€™s birth year.
You may assume that there is only one person in the database
with the name Emma Stone.

This is detailed description for beginners in programing like me:

SELECT column `birth`
FROM table `people`
WHERE column `name` LIKE "Emma Stone";
LIKE - Searches for a specified pattern in a column

---< Dumbest way is to write queries - in ONE line! >---

SELECT birth FROM people WHERE name LIKE "Emma Stone";

That's OK if line is short, BUT if they are not?

Do not forget to close your command with a semicolon ;

SELECT birth
FROM people
WHERE name LIKE "Emma Stone";
